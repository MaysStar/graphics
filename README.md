## Game simulation overview

The renderer now contains a lightweight game layer that defines three handcrafted
maps, each culminating in a unique boss encounter. The simulation tracks
exploration progress, transitions through boss introductions, manages combat, and
advances through increasing difficulty tiers until the campaign is complete.
